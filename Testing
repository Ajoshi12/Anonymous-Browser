Neel: Module: Wrote most of the TCP server, the server,py and the client.py. 
The functional testing I did was test both the server and the client files and made sure that both of them were able to talk to each other. 
Furthermore, I made sure that I ended up the contents of the files remained the same, and that they didn't get randomly deleted or anything. 

Aishu: Focused heavily on the db part, was also the main tester of the program. 
The functional testing I did was making sure that the database was able to get up and running, and made sure it was successfully able
to receive the CSV file and able to import to database. I also fixed a lot of the bugs for the program. 

Raghav: Helped fix some bugs of the TCP server, ran the TCP server proving it connects remotely connects, and wrote Browsing.py which 
runs a csv file automatically. The functional testing I did was making sure that Browsing.py and remote access control works. 

Hoa: Wrote the entire banning website url feature, and helped fix a for loop in the TCP server.
The functional testing I did was making sure that the banned website allowed non banned websites to pass, while eliminating websites that 
cannot be reused. I made sure that the loop in the TCP server was able to now store all the contents of the file, and that certain errors
were fixed. 

Abhay: I wrote the groupings.py, while fixes a couple of bug fixes to the TCP code. 
The functional testing I did was making sure the groupings.py function correctly assigned four user histories random data, and also made 
sure that the TCP server ended up working correctly. A file began deleting randomly sometimes, so I fixed that.
